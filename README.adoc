= k8s-notify
:project_name: k8s-notify

_{project_name}_ is a link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[Kubernetes Operator] that sends notifications to your favorite chat system.

== Supported Notifiers

A _notifier_ is an integration with a chat system. Here are the ones we support right now.

* Slack
* Google Hangouts Chat

== Quickstart

We're going to walk through a sample use case.

=== Deploy k8s notify

[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace k8s-notify
kubectl apply -f deploy/service_account.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/role.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/event_v1_eventsubscription_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/notify_v1_notifier_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
----

=== Subscribe to an Event

_{project_name}_ allows you to describe a type of event and subscribe to receive notifications about it. To do this, _{project_name}_ provides a _Custom Resource Definition_ called an `EventSubscription`. A simple one looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: event.redhat-cop.io/v1
kind: EventSubscription
metadata:
  name: new-pod-subscription
spec:
  matchMessage: 'Created pod'
  notifier: slack-notify
----

Write this to a file called `new-pod-subscription.yaml` and create it.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f new-pod-subscription.yaml
----

This will trigger a notification any time a new pod is created in our namespace.

=== Configuring Notifications

You may have noticed that the `EventSubscription` we created contains a reference `notifier: slack-notify`. In order to actually receive a notification, _{project_name}_ integrates with your chat provider of choice via a _Custom Resource Definition_ called a `Notifier`. This `Notifier` can be referenced by name in an `EventSubscription`. Let's create the `slack-notify` `Notifier` to send messages via Slack.

First, we'll need to create an link:https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks#create_a_webhook[Incoming Webhook]. Copy the URL generated to feed into our config.

A `Notifier` config looks like this. Make sure to paste in your webhook url.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: notify.redhat-cop.io/v1
kind: Notifier
metadata:
  name: slack-notify
spec:
  slack:
    webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/foo/bar/baz
----

Write that to a file called `notifier-slack.yaml` and create it.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f notifier-slack.yaml
----

Great, we're all set up. Let's take this sucker for a spin!

=== Trigger a Notification

Since our `EventSubscription` above triggers when a pod gets created, let's create one.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl run busybox --image=busybox
----

**DING!**
